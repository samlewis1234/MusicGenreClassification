# MusicGenreClassification

This project began as a group project in a machine learning class. I focused on creating a MLP model to train on this numeric dataset, while my other group members created a CNN on a dataset of spectrogram images. Thus, my part was already pretty removed from the rest of the project, and it was simple to seperate my work and continue it individually. 

Goals, reflection, and code explanations can be found in the attached file which contains code and the results of my models. 

Apologies for the poor formatting: This project was created in Google CoLab, where it shrinks the output of my model summary function. Since some of these took quite some time to train over 500 or 1000 epochs, I chose to leave these long summaries rather than retrain my models with a modified summary function.
